What is the project about?
Almost every CCTV camera we use today for security purposes only producing a video feed of particular area. Thus, analysing and trigger events based on the real-time video feed is obviously a very difficult task. By this project REALTIME INTELLIGENT SURVEILLANCE FOR CCTV CAMERAS
It is intended to do intelligent things like detect people, track different person separately and trigger events on business and security level based on detections from the ordinary video feed you get from the CCTV camera.

How this is going to be developed
This project is fallen under the domain of image processing and tracking techniques. And particularly this is a Realtime application uses a single camera.
Core task of the project can divide into two parts. Detect humans in a given video feed (from camera source).Track detected humans separately until they are within the camera view with handling occlusions (one person partially or fully covering another person in the video for a limited amount of time).The ultimate objective is to use this gathered information of people tracking for useful Intelligent/analytical tasks.

Input and output of the proposed system.
Input- Video feed from a CCTV camera
Output â€“ Detect people in a given time (indicate in video view itself), How many people are there in feed at a given time, given labels to each individual in order to track them separately and trigger Intelligent events based on detection
